# SWCC-Prediction-App
Uses simple geotechnical testing to predict SWCC of soil.
I have used React native, which is an open source framework for mobile application development created by Facebook, to develop this app. Both android and iOS app can be build using same piece of code in react native. 
In the app, I have used various component of react native like navigation to navigate between different component or screen, InputText for taking data input, Picker for option to select between different value, used Google Chart to create graph from equation formed by above mentioned equation for different methods and models and used webview component from react-native to show the graph. All the codes to obtain desired result is written in JavaScript language.
